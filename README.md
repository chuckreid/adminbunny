+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This file is a Discord bot written in Python. It is a simple project that I started because I have a Discord server and have recently learned Python.
I have two bunnies and they come up in conversation often via chat mention or me posting photos.  
Anyone is free to use a copy of this Python program to use as-is or to customize and change to your heart's content.

This file does assume that you have a separate .env file that contains your Discord token ID and Guild ID to reference.  Doing this, allows the code
to be shared publicly without risk of sharing that information.

Enjoy!  If you have any ideas that you think would be great additions, or know how to fix a listed issue, by all means pass along your knowledge!
Additional information will be added here as needed.
